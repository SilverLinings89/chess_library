# Chess Library

![unit tests](https://github.com/SilverLinings89/chess_library/actions/workflows/rust.yml/badge.svg)

This is a core implementation of the chess rules. It allows for following a game and exporting the state of the board as FEN. Additionally, It can check validity of moves, checks etc.

More features to follow. This is supposed to be used in both the backend and frontend and comes with no external dependencies.
